    Hi everyone and welcome to this exercices package number 2!
    Here are some problems you'll need to solve by yourself.

    We suppose that you know every block states (conditions, loop, functions, variables, ...).
    You know how to test a function, and view his result in the browser console or nodeJS output.
    Now we try to solve problems that need more thinking.

    Good luck ! and try hard (its good for you) !
